# Deleen's Home Bake Website

A small site for showcasing bakery products. Product images should be placed in
`public/img/` (they are ignored by Git), using these filenames:

- `chocolate-cake.jpg`
- `lemon-tart.jpg`
- `banana-bread.jpg`
- `blueberry-muffin.jpg`
- `croissant.jpg`
- `apple-pie.jpg`
- `carrot-cake.jpg`
- `cheesecake.jpg`
- `brownie.jpg`

## Running

Start the local server using Node.js:

```bash
node server.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the site. Orders and messages submitted
through the forms can be viewed at `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
